# Thesis_Code

Code attached to the work for the Master Thesis "A convolution process for spatial statistical models on directed linear networks".

All plots and simulations come from these codes.

## Code
### General functions
The two files present relates to the general functions necessary to run all the simulations and the constructions developed.
These are ad hoc created functions, given that there is the need to manipulate the data and the covariance model in an innovative way.
_Functions_Network_ relates to the functions aiming at constructing the network. From the dataframe df, these functions create the actual linear network. Moreover, they create the **paths** object, where all the relevant paths together with the necessary weights are stored.
_Functions_Simulation_ aims to make the actual simulations. In particular, simulate a process, creating a covariance from a paths object. Moreover, the estimation is tackled, functions for all types of estimators are defined here. Lastly, functions for prediction at unsampled locations are defined.

### Specific files

_Linear network_ : first tests on the new construction: it creates positive definite covariance models.

_Simulations_ : Many simulations performed to assess the quality of the estimator procedures.

_Projections_ : Actual case study. The projections from the 4.5 and 8.5 RCP model are used as a baseline to construct prediction intervals for the water temperature in the Mediterranean sea in 2050 and 2099.
After evaluating their covariance structure, prediction interval are evaluated.

Many different representation of the results are available, in the folder Projections
